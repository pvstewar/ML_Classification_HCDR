# ML_Classification_HCDR

__Original Project Created by Michael Casey, Andrew Cruez, Peter Stewart, and Hemraj Yadav for Indiana University Applied Machine Learning.__

The topic of this project is using Python Machine Learning to classify credit default risk based on data about individuals. The submissions included were made against the Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk) and utilized the public data for this competition.  

__Table of Contents__

1. P1_HCDR_EDA.ipynb - This section introduces the data and performs exploratory data analysis and visualization to make discoveries about the nature of the data and aid in building the ML dataset and feature engineering.
2. P2_HCDR_Dataset_build - This section is where we built the dataset with features to aid in modeling.
3. P3_HCDR_ML_Pipeline.ipynb - This section was our ML experimentation pipeline where we used various ML algorithms and metrics to measure successful classification.
4. P4_HCDR_Pytorch_Pipeline.ipynb - This section was our implementation of Pytorch to model the same data.
5. P5_HCDR_Balance.ipynb - This section was our implementation of balancing to attempt to improve the predictions in part 3.
6. HCDR_Report.pdf - This is a written report explaining the process undertaken to complete parts 1 through 4 of the original project. Refer to this PDF for more detail on the project, findings, challenges and individual assignment of credit for the project components.
